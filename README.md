# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project attempts to predict banking customer churn to identify useful trends to potentially save the banking organization money due to customers leaving the services of the bank. The original project is a Jypiter notebook that is refactorized into python script and unit tested by implementing exception handling and logging.

## Files and data description
The file directory contains churn_library.py and churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
*churn_library.py is the python script that contains the core functions of importing data, EDA, feature engineering, and validation. 
*churn_script_logging_and_tests.py is the unit testing class to test and log output information.
*data – contains the dataset used to train and test the machine learning models.
*models – contains the trained models resulting from the dataset.
*images – contains the image files of important visualizations for the churn project.
*logs – contains the resulting logfiles of unit tests performed on the script class “churn_library.py”.


## Running Files
First, ensure that your Python environment is set to run the proper version of python and the appropriate libraries are installed by running ‘pip install -r requirements_py3.6.txt’ or ‘pip install -r requirements_py3.8.txt’ for your version of Python.

“python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py” will run the unit test class to generate test output from the cmd line.
